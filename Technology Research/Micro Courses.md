# Micro Courses and Micro-Credentials
- **Definition & Format**: short, focused learning modules or courses, often outcome- or competency-based, that address a narrowly defined skill or topic. They are shorter than full‐length courses or traditional certificates/diplomas (and take a few hours / days to complete). Additionally, many micro-courses are designed so that several can be stacked together to compose a larger credential or certificate.
- **Purpose**: to fill skill gaps quickly; allow for more flexible, just-in-time learning as opposed to committing to long programs. To stimulate engagement, micro courses award digital, verifiable, and sometimes shareable (e.g. digital badges) credentials. These credentials recognize attainment of specific competencies, not just attendance. Whereas some micro-credentials are offered and backed by educational institutions, a large number of them are offered by private entities with limited external recognition.

## Engagement Drivers
- **Relevance**: if the content is directly useful to their job or solves a specific challenge (e.g. a DEI issue in their workplace), learners are more motivated. Case studies and real-life scenarios may significantly increase user interest and engagement.
- **Brevity & Focus**: because micro-courses are short, learners perceive them as less tiresome by reducing cognitive pressure. Short modules also mean someone can complete them between other commitments.
- **Flexibility in Delivery**: self-paced or blended (online + occasional synchronous), access anytime, multiple offerings per year rather than fixed-term enrollment. 
- **Quality**: clear learning objectives, strong assessments, interaction, feedback, possibly multimedia, concrete examples, and opportunities to apply learning in real situations. Rather than overloading with theory, quality micro courses focus on skills and behaviour.
- **Recognition**: even if not formally licensed, a certificate or badge that is verifiable gives learners something to show for their time. Shareability (LinkedIn, resumes) helps with motivation, especially if recognized by employers.
- **Support & Community**: sometimes learners benefit from group discussion, peer learning/supervision, mentorship or coaching. Also, reminders, follow-ups, and nudges to keep them progressing. Some micro-courses are built in with such support.
- **Modular Paths**: learners prefer having “bite-size” pieces that can accumulate toward something larger. That gives micro courses both flexibility and long-term incentive.
