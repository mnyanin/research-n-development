* **Software 2.0** is a term coined by Andrej Karpathy (former head of AI at Tesla) to describe a shift in how software is built. In traditional Software 1.0, humans write explicit instructions (code) that computers execute. In Software 2.0, instead of writing all the instructions ourselves, we train machine learning models on large amounts of data, and the models learn the behavior we want.
* Why is it important?
	* It allows us to tackle problems that are very hard or even impossible to solve with explicit rules, like image recognition, speech understanding, or language generation.
	* Models can capture extremely complex patterns from massive data that humans can't easily formalize.
