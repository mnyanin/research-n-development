# Trends
* Claude Sonnet 4.5 & Gemini 2.5 pro - the most powerful LLMs (see [LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text/expert))
* OpenAI released a [new benchmark](https://substack.com/redirect/04a7f72b-7cf0-4538-8e47-b9d536df4fa3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjVlbzlmIn0.FW8WL3Fwi5-HguK73zOMNV1rItC9pXh7ejGOMvVDUoE) to capture the understanding of cultural nuance in models, starting with India.

* Claude 2.0 [system prompt](https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/blob/main/CURSOR/Cursor_Prompt.md) is now an accessible artifact that provides inside into what happens behind the curtains.
* [Context Over Convenience](https://repoprompt.com/blog/context-over-convenience) (15 mins)
	* Don’t feed the entire codebase into the model and hope it figures out the rest.
	- Instead, **curate context**, break tasks into manageable pieces, plan architecture where needed, and then let the model reason with a clear objective.
	* Treat your own job as the planner, scoper, reviewer - don’t offload everything to the model/agent. The model is strongest when it has **good context (minimal yet sufficient) + a clear task + your review**.
* [Gamification has promise and pitfalls](https://martech.org/soapbox-gamification-has-promise-and-pitfalls/) (3 mins)
	* "The danger lies in trying to implement everything at once, making it hard to isolate what’s actually working."
	* "A fixed schedule can encourage people to repeat a simple behavior, but its appeal fades quickly."
	* "Leaderboards help participants see where they stand and can inspire higher performance, but they can also discourage those who feel too far behind to catch up."
# Tools
* [Company Knowledge](https://openai.com/index/introducing-company-knowledge/) connects multiple business tools together to provide more powerful responses within the context of the company.
